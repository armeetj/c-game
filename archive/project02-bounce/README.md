# project02

For this project, you should begin by adding all your files from the previous project (except for your Makefile and .vscode folder - we've made a few changes to those).  Because these diverge based on group, we're asking you to do this manually.
If you can't figure out the `git` comands, please ask at office hours!

Please also remember to submit the Qualtrics form before the deadline! Link here: https://caltech.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_6imPeo1nHVGhSK2
